# hangman
hangman.py is a program that will generate a dictionary word 
and ask the user to guess the word one letter at a time. 
The user will have a number of lives that will be set up in the beginning of the game. 
After the user uses all lives or guesses the word correctly, the programs will ask the user to play again.
